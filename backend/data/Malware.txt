Malware, short for malicious software, encompasses various types of harmful software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can infect devices through various vectors, such as email attachments, infected websites, or removable media.

Viruses attach themselves to legitimate programs and replicate when the host program is executed. Worms are self-replicating and spread across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities. Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software to deceive users and deliver malicious payloads.

Ransomware encrypts files, demanding payment for their release, while spyware covertly gathers sensitive information. Adware displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with legitimate software.

Malware can have severe consequences, leading to data loss, financial theft, and system disruption. Antivirus and anti-malware tools are crucial for prevention and detection. Cybersecurity measures, regular updates, and user education are essential to mitigate the risks associated with malware attacks.
