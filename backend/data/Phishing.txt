Phishing is a cyber attack that involves tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords and financial details, by posing as a trustworthy entity. Commonly conducted through deceptive emails, messages, or websites, phishing exploits human psychology to manipulate recipients into disclosing confidential data. Attackers often use social engineering tactics, creating fake communication that appears legitimate, urging recipients to click on malicious links or provide personal information. Phishing attacks can also employ methods like spear phishing, targeting specific individuals or organizations.

The consequences of falling victim to phishing include identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized access to sensitive accounts. To combat phishing, users are advised to verify email sources, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and employ security measures like two-factor authentication. Organizations implement anti-phishing technologies and educate employees about recognizing phishing attempts to enhance cybersecurity. Despite efforts to raise awareness, phishing remains a prevalent and evolving threat in the realm of cybercrime.
